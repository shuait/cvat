 2. **Function Panel**. A Button to create new worker instance. After pressing *Create Worker/Track* button, hover your mouse to Annotation Panel and place the default skeleton to proper area.  

    - use the correct skeleton **left-right** orientation. We use worker's left and right as the correct orientation. Before placing the skeleton, press "**Ctrl**" key and move your mouse to switch left and right. 


 3. **Annotation Area**. Main region to diaplay frames and annotated keypoints. Hover over the displayed image, press left mouse key and drag to move the image; use mouse middle wheel to scale the image.
    - flag occluded keypoints. Hover your mouse to a occluded keypoint and press ``s`` to set it as occluded, press again to cancel. If a keypoint is annotated as occluded, it will stay as occulded unless another keyframe says otherwise.


 4. **Worker Labels**. All created worker instances will show up here. For each worker, the **eye** icon is used to set visibility of keypoints for this worker at current frame; the **solid star** icon indicates at least one keypoints of this worker at current frame is annotated by human, such frame is called a **keyframe**.

    - Clicking on the progress bar allows you jump to frames, and buttons implement the following utilities.

    - button in <span style="color:green">green box</span>: play/pause, <span style="color:red">red box</span>: next frame, <span style="color:blue">blue box</span>: 10 frame forward, <span style="color:orange">orange box</span>: end frame. Buttons on the other side have same functions for backward playback.

    - hotkeys to progress bar buttons:
        - ``space`` : play/pause.
        - ``e``: previous keyframe; ``r``: next keyframe 
        - ``d``: previous frame; ``f``: next frame.
        - ``c``: jump to 10 frames before; ``v``: jump to 10 frames ahead.

    - to set playback speed and forward step size go to settings (``Open Menu`` â€”> ``Settings``), modify ``Player Speed`` to change playback speed, change ``Player Step`` property to change step size.
